# The Strap
This repository contains the necessary resources to use the Strap as a MIDI controller implemented with Pure Data running on Bela to navigate a musical piece with [Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com/). 

To try it out with your own MIDI device, open https://psxjpm.github.io/Strap/public/index.html in Google Chrome, select a MIDI device from your machine and press start. 

The 'slice' has been embedded in: https://psxjpm.github.io/Strap/public/index.html and the UI can be controlled using MIDI via the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#dom-midimessageevent) and Soundslice's [Player API](https://www.soundslice.com/help/player-api/). 

The host webpage and MIDI functionality is based on Chris Greenhalgh's original demo: https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/soundslice-demo
